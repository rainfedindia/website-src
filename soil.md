fe in rainfed areas depends on the quantum of moisture and nutrients that the top-most layer of soil (about one foot deep) can absorb and retain during the shorter monsoon periods.

The deteriorating health of soils owing to overuse of fertilisers and the low investment in rainfed regions has led to a **stagnation in Indian agriculture** - both irrigated and rainfed. The consequence of this is the **crisis of food** security that faces India today. While conservation is the first step, soils in rainfed areas need regular annual addition of organic matter to trap moisture. The efficiency of chemicals, seeds and other inputs depends heavily on organic matter in soils. With incomes stagnant in these areas, rainfed farmers cannot generate the surpluses required to make such investments. Therefore, soil health in rainfed areas must be treated as a national public good, requiring public investment.

Rainfed regions need investment, but not just in the form of chemical fertilisers. Investments must be substantial and appropriate. Therefore, it is crucial to **invest in the addition of organic matter** to rejuvenate soils and improve their capacity to hold water,improve soil structure, support soil life and as well supply nutrients to plants.For rainfed agriculture especially, shifting of investments towards addition of organic matter is the need of the hour. 

Invest in

* Integrating natural resources management into improvement of production

* NRM around biomass

* Improving soil health by adding biomass

* Invest in recurring processes in addition to infrastructure creation

With this realisation, Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture (RRA) Network has initiated an experiment on the ground in nine sites spread over five states - Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Orissa - led by five partner organisations. 

The interventions being promoted are as per the 10 modules given under:

* Improving quantity and quality of farm yard manure/compost at homesteads.

* Improving quantity and quality of biomass-based manure at farms.

* Green manures and cropping systems

* Concentrated manures

* Soil amendments

* Livestock penning

* Mulching, cover crops and reduction in the intensity of tillage

* Soil and moisture conservation

* Bio-fertilisers

* Soil and moisture conservation

These modules are packaged into major components like

* Biomass based manure in rainfed soils and green manuring in lowlands

* Tank silt application in light soils

* Promotion of enterprises on liquid manures

The purpose is to evolve the structure of a possible public investment programme on enhancing soil productivity using organic matter. The pilots will help in detailing methods of implementation, incentives to encourage farmers and build their capacity, measurement and payment.
