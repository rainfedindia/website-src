Erratic monsoons in rainfed regions require repeat sowing and contingency crops. In an abnormal year, the loss of a crop leads to a shortage of seeds in the subsequent year.

Availability of quality seeds before the monsoon is therefore crucial in rainfed agriculture, as the 'sowing window' is small. The terrain in rainfed areas also requires hardy seeds that can weather these constraints.

Diversification is key to survival and there is a range of seeds, including indigenous varieties, that perform well in such conditions. Yet the existing seed industry has little space for such seeds.

###RRAN Invests in:

* Incubating local organisations for production, distribution and development of seeds of locally adapted (diverse) crops and varieties

* Developing more localised and diversified seed standards
