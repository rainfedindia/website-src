Atlas of rainfed agriculture: We are producing a visual representation of RRAâ€™s core arguments using publicly available data on Indian agriculture. This atlas will demonstrate the diversity of biophysical, agroecological, and socio-political contexts within the broad umbrella of rainfed areas. Using this foundation, the atlas will then illustrate the misalignment between the existing regimes of public investments in agriculture with this diversity. Finally, the atlas will present several opportunities for agricultural growth through a restructuring of the nature, amount, and delivery of public investment. 

Here is a sample page from the Atlas

The baseline data is currently being analyzed. Check back in September 2015 for a visual representation of some of our key findings. For a basic visualisation of primary characteristics of sample villages, check out the Apps section below:
