Livelihoods in rainfed areas depend on the window of rainfall during the monsoons. “Nearly 60% of net sown area belongs to rainfed agriculture. More than 55% of farmers still practice rainfed farming. It is estimated number of farmers in rainfed will reach 600 million by 2020” (Farrington, Sulaiman, and Pal 1997).  Due to the impact of climate change, there is an erratic pattern of dry spells during kharif. To ensure crop security, rainfed areas need buffers against dry spells. “Water for all “and “Water to secure livelihoods “must be the premise for public investment in rainfed areas.

The Crisis, and Opportunity in Rainfed: The major challenge in mitigating crop failures in rainfed areas is protection, conservation and intelligent use of water resources. Unpredictable shifts in climate and changes in crop systems have created instability in the fragile lives of rainfed farmers. The crisis in rainfed ecologies is exacerbating the dependency on groundwater. Dependency on groundwater extraction is leading to exhaustion of groundwater buffers

Need of the hour is a flexible policy framework which can incorporate localized solutions to address crop failures in rainfed areas. 

RRA Network believes that a combination of new technology, traditional knowledge systems, community ownership and smart infrastructure can address rainfed exigencies.

Rethinking of Public investment in rainfed agriculture with focus on access and use of water resources. Re-visioning of policy framework with motto “more value per crop per drop “. 

RRA believes in this New Vision “Water in Rainfed” which encompasses the following principles to drive water investments:

1. ‘Water for All’ - for all farmers for optimal security.

1. “Value for Drop” Shifting from intensive cropping systems to diversified systems with protective irrigation.

1. Sustainability of sources, systems and purpose.

1. Primacy of drinking water for humans and animals & for ecological restoration.

1. Paradigm shift from “Water as Irrigation” to “Water as moisture”. 

1. Participatory Governance to realise the best inclusive-value for water.

1.  Policy framework to regulate indiscriminate exploitation of groundwater.

1. Re-enforcing groundwater as “Common pooled resource” instead of as “individually owned resource”. RRA Network envisions “Water Resources for Development” rather than an ‘irrigation development’. It belives in inclusive and sustainable water resources development for rainfed areas in Agro-ecological Zones.

With above principles in view, RRA Network has piloted integrated approaches to address crop failures and to make rainfed agriculture resilient to dry spells. Successful implementation of pilots in Anantapur and Mahabubnagar proves conceptual framework can be successfully grounded in rainfed areas.

RRA Pilot initiatives for climate change resilient agriculture have shown that participatory planning, revisioning of groundwater as commons with community ownership are the game changers. RRA believes that new policy initiatives are required for the long-term inclusive growth.”Water in Rainfed” is an idea whose time has come.

###Invest in:

* Extensive protective irrigation to secure rainfed crops

* Collectivising groundwater (and surface water) for extensive protective irrigation

* Harnessing the hydrological functions of soil and effective use of local water bodies

* Creating positive incentives for collectivisation

* Integrated development of soils, crops and water resources.
