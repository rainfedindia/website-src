Rainfed India has been left out of mainstream development in agriculture due to the government's emphasis on generating food surplus from intensively irrigated areas to meet food security needs of the nation. RRAN aims to evolve appropriate policies rooted in the realities of rainfed areas. It advocates for increased and appropriate public investments to strengthen rainfed agriculture. 



Falling groundwater levels, declining soil productivity, degradation of commons and increasing costs of inputs have led to stagnant incomes and entrenched poverty in rainfed areas. But the potential for higher growth in crop productivity, incomes from livestock - in particular, goats and sheep - and fisheries has not been realised for lack of relevant public investments.

Therefore, a distinctive policy focus and substantial investments to revitalise the diverse and integrated production systems in rainfed areas is needed. Such a policy must also build on the key strengths of women as farmers and knowledge keepers.

If there were parity in investment with irrigated areas, rainfed regions would have high potential for growth. If rainfed farmers received regular public investment of the magnitude that goes into per hectare of irrigated land, they would be able to improve soil productivity by regularly adding organic matter, ensure higher moisture retention and make their crop systems resilient to climate variability. The productivity gains would then be substantial.

Even a single intervention during a period of drought, namely the provision of protective irrigation, has the potential to improve crop yields by 29 to 114 per cent. (Sharma, Rao, et al., 2006; Realising the Potential of rainfed Agriculture in India)
Making appropriate investments in soil, water, seeds, integrated crop systems, livestock, fisheries and in developing credit, markets and institutions in support of these will go a long way in making the vision of Inclusive Growth a Reality.
